            Hi Everyone, I am Reyaz, persuing my 3rd yr in Btech (Computer Science and Enginnering) at KL University, Guntur.
            My background in web development, computer coding, and time management inform me mindful but competitive approach. 
            
            I considers myself a "forever student", eager to both build on my academic foundation and my entrepreneur skills. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            My hunger for knowledge and determination to learn computer skills made me learn the main programing languages
            which include Java, Python, C, JavaSrcipt, HTML, CSS. I can also use web developing tools like Wordpress and Webflow.
            My skills inclde excellent IT skills, especially with design and photo-editing software and graphic design tools such as Photoshop,
            Adobe Illustrator, ProShow and Flash Mx.  I'm Highly creative and have good time management and organisational skills.
            I understand the latest trends and their role within a commercial environment and learn the skills required accordingly.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do are working out at gym, playing games, watching webseries. 
            As an adventure seeker, I want to travel as much as I can. Reach out to reyazst3@gmail.com to connect!
